        <u>Team Manager</u>
        <br> Argos Bristol LFC (May 2021-March 2025)
        <br>
        </p>
        <p class="cv-p">
        The Bristol LFC is a fulfilment centre covering Bristol, Bath,
        Gloucester, Swindon and going as far south as Bridgwater,
        shipping out thousands of orders per day. As part of my role, I
        was responsible for the development of various tools used to
        assist with the running of the site. These included:
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li class="job-list">
          A system for the stores we delivered too to report back any
          discrepancies with their deliveries and get a live response on the
          actions to take, to enable the quickest resolution for their
          customers. The tool could also analyse the reports to identify
          trends such as if the same stores had the most errors, if the
          same items were going missing, and generate daily, weekly,
          monthly, and yearly reports.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="job-list">
          A tool that could take rotas and return information on the
          specific number of colleagues in at a certain time, the number of
          colleagues in for various roles, and the salary cost to the
          business of specific shifts, accounting for things such as breaks
          and premiums.
          </li>
          <br>
          <li class="job-list">
          A tool to collate various reports available to us from the
          company and automatically generate monthly and yearly
          colleague performance reports from them.
          </li>.
          <br>
          <li class="job-list">
          Automating various processes in tools provided to us by the
          company where previously the data had to be input manually
          multiple times a day.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="cv-p">
        I was also responsible for auditing our weekly delivery
        paperwork and fuel receipts, and if I discover any discrepancies,
        reporting them and putting in processes to mitigate any future
        issues.

        <u>Scout Leader (2012-Present)</u>
        </p>
        <p class="cv-p">
        Since leaving scouts myself, I have been a leader for the 28th Kingwood District specialising
        in training young people to complete the Ten Tors' Challenge. The Challenge is run by the
        army and consist of teams of 6 hiking 35, 45 or 55 miles across Dartmoor over 2 days.
        In my role I am responsible for taking the young people in our group on practise hikes to build
        up their endurance, teaching them navigation, survival and camping skills as well as
        attending monthly meetings of our scout leadership team where we discuss finances, risks,
        training plans etc.
